# net-transport

Net Transport is my personal custom made multiplayer framework, utilizing the **System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient** class as a base message processor.

My focus is to make it as intuitive and easy to use as possible by focusing on code sugar, whilst also trying keeping everything as optimized as possible.

Net Transport is developed and tested in the Unity game engine, but can safely run in any C# project that has supports **System.Net.Sockets**.
